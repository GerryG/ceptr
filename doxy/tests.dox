/**
   @page howto_tests Running the self-tests

   The codebase is heavily tested since we use test-driven development practices.

   To compile and run all tests, just cd into the root directory and type "make"

   Also, we've organized things so that you can find the tests for the functions right
   in the documentation for each function.
