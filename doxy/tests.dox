/**
   @page howto_tests Running the self-tests

   The codebase is heavily tested as we use test-driven develpment practices.

   To compile and run all tests simple cd into the root directory and type "make"

   Also, we've set things up so that Doxygen inserts the tests for the functions right
   in the documentation for each function.
