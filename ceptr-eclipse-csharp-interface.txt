====================================
Building ceptr as an executable in Eclipse
====================================

File -> New -> C Project
	Enter the project name (ceptr)
	Select Executable -> Empty Project
	Select MinGW GCC as the toolchain

Right-click on the new project:
New -> Source Folder
	Enter "src"

Right-click on the new project:
New -> Source Folder
	Enter "spec"

Drag and drop the files in your ceptr folder (cloned from GitHub) into the Eclipse source folder
Select "Link to files" so that when you rebase, Eclipse gets the changes.

Do the same for the files in the "spec" folder, dropping them as links into the Eclipse "spec" folder.

Build and run.

Select the dropdown on the "run" icon (round green symbol with a white arrow)
Select C/C++ Application on the left
Click "New" (the first icon with a "+" symbol in the upper right corner)
Click "Run"

In ceptr.h, comment out:
	#include <pthread.h>
as I haven't figured out how to include support for pthread in Windows.  Some references:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2150938/can-i-get-cs-pthread-h-to-compile-in-windows
http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/

You can from then on run the program, if you have more than one project in your workspace, use the dropdown on the "run" icon to select the desired project.

====================================
Building ceptr as a shared library in Eclipse
====================================

File -> New -> C Project
	Enter the project name (ceptrlib)
	Select Shared Library -> Empty Project
	Select MinGW GCC as the toolchain

Right-click on the new project:
New -> Source Folder
	Enter "src"

Drag and drop the files in your ceptr folder (cloned from GitHub) into the Eclipse source folder
Select "Link to files" so that when you rebase, Eclipse gets the changes.

This create "libceptrlib.dll" (annoyingly, Eclipse added "lib" at the beginning of the project, but we can't name our project "ceptr" because it conflicts with the executable version.

The resulting dll is in c:\Users\[you]\workspace\ceptrlib\Debug as libceptrlib.dll

====================================
Calling C functions from C#
====================================

Create a simple "test.c" function in ceptrlib/src:

#include "stdio.h"

void Test()
{
	printf("Hello World\r\n");
}

Create a C# console application.  Copy the libceptrlib.dll into the bin\Debug folder of your new project.

Change Program.cs to read:

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace ceptrlibtest
{
	class Program
	{
		[DllImport("libceptrlib.dll")]
		extern static void Test();

		static void Main(string[] args)
		{
			Test();
		}
	}
}

Run it.  The output in the console window will be:

Hello World
Press any key to continue...
